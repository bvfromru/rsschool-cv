## About Me
Basically, I'm a "switcher". Although, I have some practical experience in HTML and CSS, but it was more like a hobby, not a full-time job. Now I've decided to become a professional front-end developer. So my goal is to study all the tecnologies a good specialist needs, find a job and make my way from junior developer to further levels. And I beleive I have enought perseverance and potential to achieve this!

## Skills
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (basic)
- CMS Joomla/Wordpress
- Git/GitHub
- Photoshop/Figma

## Code Example
**"Nickname Generator" kata from Codewars:** *Write a function, nicknameGenerator that takes a string name as an argument and returns the first 3 or 4 letters as a nickname. If the 3rd letter is a consonant, return the first 3 letters.*

```javascript
function nicknameGenerator(name){
  if (name.length < 4) {
    return 'Error: Name too short';
  }
  const vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'];
  let nicknameLength = 3;
  if (vowels.includes(name[2])) {
    nicknameLength = 4;
  }
  return name.substr(0, nicknameLength);
}
```
